			<p class="verseline">You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods </p>
			<p class="verseline">No more obey the heavens than our courtiers </p>
			<p class="verseline">Still seem as does the Kingâ€™s</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">But whatâ€™s the matter? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">His daughter, and the heir ofâ€™s kingdom, whom </p>
			<p class="verseline">He purposâ€™d to his wifeâ€™s sole son- a widow </p>
			<p class="verseline">That late he married- hath referrâ€™d herself </p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. Sheâ€™s wedded; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her husband banishâ€™d; she imprisonâ€™d. All </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is outward sorrow, though I think the King </p>
			<p class="verseline">Be touchâ€™d at very heart</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">None but the King? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That most desirâ€™d the match. But not a courtier, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Although they wear their faces to the bent </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of the Kingâ€™s looks, hath a heart that is not </p>
			<p class="verseline">Glad at the thing they scowl at</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">And why so? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">He that hath missâ€™d the Princess is a thing </p>
			<p class="verseline">Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her- </p>
			<p class="verseline">I mean that married her, alack, good man! </p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore banishâ€™d- is a creature such </p>
			<p class="verseline">As, to seek through the regions of the earth </p>
			<p class="verseline">For one his like, there would be something failing </p>

			<p class="verseline">So fair an outward and such stuff within </p>
			<p class="verseline">Endows a man but he</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">You speak him far</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do extend him, sir, within himself; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Crush him together rather than unfold </p>
			<p class="verseline">His measure duly</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whatâ€™s his name and birth? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">I cannot delve him to the root; his father </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was callâ€™d Sicilius, who did join his honour </p>
			<p class="verseline">Against the Romans with Cassibelan, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But had his titles by Tenantius, whom </p>
			<p class="verseline">He servâ€™d with glory and admirâ€™d success, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So gainâ€™d the sur-addition Leonatus; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And had, besides this gentleman in question, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Two other sons, who, in the wars oâ€™ thâ€™ time, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Died with their swords in hand; for which their father, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow </p>
			<p class="verseline">That he quit being; and his gentle lady, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceasâ€™d </p>
			<p class="verseline">As he was born. The King he takes the babe </p>
			<p class="verseline">To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Puts to him all the learnings that his time </p>
			<p class="verseline">Could make him the receiver of; which he took, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As we do air, fast as â€˜twas ministâ€™red, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And inâ€™s spring became a harvest, livâ€™d in court- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which rare it is to do- most praisâ€™d, most lovâ€™d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A sample to the youngest; to thâ€™ more mature </p>
			<p class="verseline">A glass that feated them; and to the graver </p>
			<p class="verseline">A child that guided dotards. To his mistress, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For whom he now is banishâ€™d- her own price </p>
			<p class="verseline">Proclaims how she esteemâ€™d him and his virtue; </p>
			<p class="verseline">By her election may be truly read </p>
			<p class="verseline">What kind of man he is</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">I honour him </p>
			<p class="verseline">Even out of your report. But pray you tell me, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is she sole child to thâ€™ King? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">His only child</p>
			<p class="verseline">He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Iâ€™ thâ€™ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were stolâ€™n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which way they went</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">How long is this ago? </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">Some twenty years</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">That a kingâ€™s children should be so conveyâ€™d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So slackly guarded, and the search so slow </p>
			<p class="verseline">That could not trace them! </p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">Howsoeâ€™er â€˜tis strange, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or that the negligence may well be laughâ€™d at, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet is it true, sir</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do well believe you</p>

			<p class="verseline">That opportunity, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which then they had to take from â€˜s, to resume </p>

			<p class="verseline">The first that ever touchâ€™d him- he was carried </p>
			<p class="verseline">From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping- </p>
